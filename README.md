Need a random company name or an IBAN while testing your webapp? Say no more.

This extension adds a sidebar menu that lets you quickly generate random data for your inputs!

## Installing

1. Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
2. Change or configure the name of your extension on `src/manifest`.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Developing

run the command

```shell
$ cd fake-data-ext

$ npm run dev
```

To test the extension you can also host a simple form locally with the command

$ npm run run-demo
```

The demo is then available under `http://localhost:3000/`

1. set your Chrome browser 'Developer mode' up
2. click 'Load unpacked', and select `fake-data-ext/build` folder

### Nomal FrontEnd Developer Mode
